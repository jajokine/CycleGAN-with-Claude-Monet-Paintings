# CycleGAN-with-Monet-Paintings
Capturing the special characteristics of Monet paintings inorder to turn ordinary pictures into Monet paintings

In a CycleGAN model we can obtain image-to-image translations without paired examples. This means the algorithm learns the specific features of an image that it then reproduces in the form of another image that has similar features compared to the original one. In fact, so similar that it is difficult to spot a fake from the original one. This could mean for example learning the details of a zebra and transforming the images of horses into zebras. Or we could have a winter seasonal landscape transformed into the same landscape but during summertime. In this project we will try to learn the specific stroke techniques and color-usage of a French painter Claude Monet and transform ordinary pictures into paintings. 

The CycleGAN model has a similar structure than a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that trains two models at the same time: one that generates a replicate of an original sample and the other that discriminates the generated replicates. However, in the CycleGAN we have two generators and two discriminators that operate in a cycle aimed in making a replicate of the original picture that is as close as possible to the original. Each training update the generators become a bit better at making a replicates and the discriminators in turn, better at spotting a fake from the original. One generator focuses on transforming a picture into a painting and the other transforming a painting into a picture. The two discriminators then try to spot the mistakes made in the replicates, leading eventually to a fast learning of the representations of the features of the paintings. This is the same as training a model to translate a sentence from English to French, and then translating this sentence again back from French to English.
